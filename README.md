# hello-world
I have joined github to access the Johns Hopkins raw covid-19 data.  Within github there is an archive of daily new cases by country, I would like to see the trend curve for the United States here as compared to other countries.  I would also like to do the same with California but State data is not available here (I think Wiki may have a break down of daily cases for California, or almost daily).
I'm adding a couple sentences, that's all, so as to procede through the tutorial.  This added text, therefore, could be thought of as filler.
